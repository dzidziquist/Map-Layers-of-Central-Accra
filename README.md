Using the Pyrosm is a Python library for reading OpenStreetMap from Protocolbuffer Binary Format -files (*.osm.pbf) into Geopandas GeoDataFrames. I retrieve the shapefiles of the building and driving road network in Accra, the captial city in Ghana. Uploaded these files into QGIS to map out the central part of the Accra and exported it to used in Tableau for visualization.
